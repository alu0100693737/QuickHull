# QuickHull
Quickhull is a method of computing the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane. It uses a divide and conquer approach similar to that of quicksort, which its name derives from. Its average case complexity is considered to be O(n * log(n)), whereas in the worst case it takes O(n2) (quadratic).
